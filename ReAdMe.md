# Python Projects
This projects shows the use of python programming language in python projects to improve python knowlegde and coding skills.

## ðŸ“¦ Projects Included

### 1.Bullet Point Adder
A simple script that takes a list of items from the user and automatically formats each line as a bullet point. Useful for quickly creating Markdown or note-ready lists.

### 2.Countdown Timer
A basic countdown timer that takes input in seconds and counts down to zero, printing the time left each second. Great for learning time-based control in Python.

### 3.Magic 8 Ball
A fun, interactive command-line version of the classic Magic 8 Ball game. Ask a yes/no question, and the script randomly responds with one of several preset answers.

### 4. "Uhm" Counter
A utility script that helps track how many times a person says "uhm" during a speech. It uses:
- `pynput.keyboard` to monitor keypresses in real-time
- `time` to track duration

This project helped me explore basic real-time input monitoring and audio-text speech habits.

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Built These
These projects helped me:
- Practice real-world Python syntax
- Get comfortable with logic, user input, and string manipulation
- Understand basic timing, randomness, and keyboard input handling
